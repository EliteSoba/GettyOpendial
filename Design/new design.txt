Set(Var) -> module work to properly set the results
Grounds or requests grounding; in latter case user will confirm and grounding will happen
in grounding step, add column to query stack and add key-value pair to attributes map
get paintings; title shouldn't be set yet; if small number (<6) of paintings, give suggestions
if large number of paintings
get artists if artists isnt set yet; if small number of artists, suggest artists.
